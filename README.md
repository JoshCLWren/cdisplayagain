Remake of cdisplay in Python.

CDisplay Sequential Image Viewer

The Windows Image Viewer 'CDisplay' was written to ease the viewing of images in JPEG, PNG and static GIF format.  This was partly down to the existing programs currently available being too general purpose and thus awkward to use when simply wanting to view images sequentially.

It was written using Borland C++ Builder 5.0 and has been tested under Windows 98, NT 4, 2000 and XP Tablet.

It is important to understand that this program has NO file write capabilities; files are left totally untouched.  A small amount of configuration data is written to the registry but apart from that the computer and its data is left untouched.

Features:

Loads JPEG, PNG and static GIF images which are automatically ordered and presented for viewing one at a time or two at a time.

The images may be in a zip, rar, ace or tar archive file - no need to decompress before reading.

Page through the images sequentially and scroll around pages with single key presses.

Automatic page sizing: none; fit to screen, fit to width of screen, fit to width of screen if oversized, display at specific height, or display two pages.  Resizing uses Lanczos interpolation for best picture quality.

Automatic colour balance and yellow reduction if desired.

No bloat caused by non-essential general purpose image processing features.
